/**

 * @short_description: MI-X Video Buffer Parameters
 *
 *<para>
 * #MixBuffer objects are used to wrap input data buffers in a reference counted object as
 * described in the buffer model section. Data buffers themselves are allocated by the
 * App/MMF. #MixBuffer objects are allocated by #MixVideo in a pool and retrieved by the
 * application using mix_video_get_mixbuffer(). The application will wrap a data buffer
 * in a #Mixbuffer object and pass it into mix_video_decode() or to mix_video_encode().
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * The #MixBuffer objects will be released by #MixVideo when they are no longer needed
 * for the decode or encoder operation. The App/MMF will also release the #MixBuffer
 * object after use. When the #MixBuffer is completely released, the callback to the
 * function registered in the #MixBuffer will be called (allowing the App/MMF to release
 * data buffers as necessary).
 * </para>
